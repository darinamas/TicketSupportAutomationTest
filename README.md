# TicketSupportAutomationTest

😊 This repository contains a case study for automating ticket support using Selenium, Page Object Model (POM), and JUnit.

## Introduction

🚀 In this project, we aim to automate the ticket support process using Selenium, a popular web automation tool. By implementing the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern, we can achieve a modular and maintainable code structure. The test cases are written using JUnit, a widely used testing framework in Java.

## Prerequisites

🔧 To run this project locally, you need to have the following installed:

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Maven
- Selenium WebDriver
- JUnit

## Getting Started

👣 To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
3. Install the required dependencies using Maven.
4. Configure the necessary WebDriver for your browser (e.g., ChromeDriver, GeckoDriver).
5. Update the test data and configurations in the respective files.
6. Run the test cases using JUnit.

## Project Structure

📁 The project is structured as follows:

- `src/main/java`: Contains the page object classes and utility classes.
- `src/test/java`: Contains the test classes for executing the test cases.
- `src/test/resources`: Contains the test data and configuration files.

## Test Execution

🔬 To execute the test cases, follow these steps:

1. Open your preferred IDE and navigate to the project.
2. Locate the test class containing the desired test case.
3. Right-click on the test class and select "Run" or "Debug".
4. Monitor the test execution progress and check for any failures or errors.
